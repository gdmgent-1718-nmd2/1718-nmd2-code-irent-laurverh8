                <h1>Dexter</h1>

                <h2>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</h2>
                <p>Hello, Dexter Morgan. Tell him time is of the essence. Makes me a … scientist. Makes me a … scientist. Like a sloth. I can do that. Keep your mind limber.</p>
                <p>You look…perfect. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. <strong> And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</strong> <em> I love Halloween.</em> The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</p>
                <h2>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.</h2>
                <p>Keep your mind limber. I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

                <h3>Makes me a … scientist.</h3>
                <p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. God created pudding, and then he rested. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm partial to air conditioning. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</li><li>Only you could make those words cute.</li><li>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Watching ice melt. This is fun. Cops, another community I'm not part of.</p>
                <p>I'm generally confused most of the time. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I have a dark side, too.</p>
                <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. You look…perfect. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>
                <p>Makes me a … scientist. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others.</p>
                <p>You look…perfect. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. You all right, Dexter? Tell him time is of the essence.</p>
                <p>I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm generally confused most of the time.</p>
                <p>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
                <p>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>

                <p>You all right, Dexter? Makes me a … scientist. I like seafood. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</p>
