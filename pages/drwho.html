            <h2>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</h2>
            
            <p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
            <p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! <strong> I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</strong> <em> Stop talking, brain thinking.</em> Hush.</p>
            <h2>You've swallowed a planet!</h2>
            <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</p>

            <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>

            <li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li><li>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</li><li>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
            <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
            <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>

            <p>You hit me with a cricket bat. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</p>

            <p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
