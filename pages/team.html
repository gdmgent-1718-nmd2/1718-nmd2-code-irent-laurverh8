    <h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2>
    <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled 
    dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into 
    a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, 
    and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
    brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into 
    stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover 
    <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide 
    off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin 
    compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about 
    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
    thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human 
    room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
    between its four familiar walls.</p>
    <h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2>
    <p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur 
    boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that 
    covered the whole of her lower arm towards the 
    viewer.</p>
